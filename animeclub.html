        “Can Saitama beat Goku though?” This is one of the questions that a lot
        of Dragon Ball fans kept on asking like crazy when someone posts an
        overpowered character over social media and forums. Well-known powerful
        anime characters such as Uchiha Madara, Whitebeard, Gol D. Roger,
        Gildarts, and Escanor have been analyzed thoroughly by fans but failed
        to see if they can beat Goku though. But Saitama, A.K.A. One-Punch Man,
        has been a long-running contender in this endless battle of anime
        character power measurement to finally beat everyone’s favorite Saiyan.
        While Saitama certainly is a powerful character, he couldn’t really
        defeat Goku, no. He could defeat a weaker Goku from years ago, but at
        this point in his life, Goku is simply so much above Saitama’s level
        that the protagonist of One-Punch Man couldn’t really do much against
        him. Goku wouldn’t even have to resort to his most powerful form to beat
        Saitama, although he would have to put in a lot of effort. This is a
        crazy battle that every fan would love to watch if only there’s a means
        for authors of Dragon Ball and One-Punch Man to make a one-shot out of
        it. The rest of this article will further elaborate on the above-given
        answer, as we are going to compare the characters through several
        categories; you are going to see who the stronger of the two is and why
        our answer is like it is, i.e., why Goku would, according to our
        analysis, be able to defeat Saitama.</big>
