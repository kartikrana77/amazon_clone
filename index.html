        “Can Saitama beat Goku though?” This is one of the questions that a lot
        of Dragon Ball fans kept on asking like crazy when someone posts an
        overpowered character over social media and forums. Well-known powerful
        anime characters such as Uchiha Madara, Whitebeard, Gol D. Roger,
        Gildarts, and Escanor have been analyzed thoroughly by fans but failed
        to see if they can beat Goku though. But Saitama, A.K.A. One-Punch Man,
        has been a long-running contender in this endless battle of anime
        character power measurement to finally beat everyone’s favorite
        Saiyan.While Saitama certainly is a powerful character, he couldn’t
        really defeat Goku, no. He could defeat a weaker Goku from years ago,
        but at this point in his life, Goku is simply so much above Saitama’s
        level that the protagonist of One-Punch Man couldn’t really do much
        against him. Goku wouldn’t even have to resort to his most powerful form
        to beat Saitama, although he would have to put in a lot of effort. This
        is a crazy battle that every fan would love to watch if only there’s a
        means for authors of Dragon Ball and One-Punch Man to make a one-shot
        out of it. The rest of this article will further elaborate on the
        above-given answer, as we are going to compare the characters through
        several categories; you are going to see who the stronger of the two is
        and why our answer is like it is, i.e., why Goku would, according to our
        analysis, be able to defeat Saitama.

        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
      <li> <strong> <ins>Superhuman strength:</ins> </strong> As a Saiyan, Goku
        possesses a vast array of superhuman physical attributes, which he has
        trained to
          God-like levels through years of rigorous training.
        Superhuman Strength: As a Saiyan, Goku possesses immense physical
        strength, far more advanced than that of any human being, and most alien
        races. He is strong enough to effortlessly break all Earthling-made
        materials or weapons, move in increased gravity without any discomfort,
        and even lift a suit capable of sinking through a planet. His physical
        strength is great enough that he can harm notably durable opponents.<br /></li> 
        <br />
      <li>  <strong> <ins>Superhuman Speed:</ins> </strong> Goku can move/react to
        fast paced fighters, including characters said to be as fast or faster
        than light, and cross vast distances in a short time span. It's also
        said that he moves faster than can be seen. <br /></li>
        <br />
      <li>  <strong><ins>Superhuman Durability:</ins> </strong>Goku's body is far more durable than
        that of normal human beings, being essentially invulnerable to all
        Earthling-made weapons. He can survive attacks that would dramatically
        harm other fighters. However, while naturally durable thanks to his
        Saiyan physiology and training, he does have limits, as other powerful
        beings as himself can hurt, and potentially kill him, if he does not
        defend himself correctly, and when purposely lowering his guard and ki
        to protect him, even an ordinary energy gun shot, was capable of leaving
        him near death.<br /></li>
        <br />
        <li><strong> <ins>Superhuman Senses:</ins></strong> Goku is able to think
        and react at extremely high speeds, easily able to dodge or catch
        projectiles fired from weapons, or even keep up with incredible combat
        speeds from his opponents. As a Saiyan, Goku also has enhanced senses of
        smell, taste and sight, which further increase his combat senses and
        instincts. <br /></li>
        <br />
       <li><strong> <ins> Superhuman Endurance:</ins></strong> Thanks to his physiology and
        willpower, Goku is capable of exerting himself even if fatigued from
        using techniques or transformations that cost a lot of his energy or
        wounded. This was shown when he defeated Piccolo when he was younger
        despite his limbs being broken and was mortally wounded.<br /></li>
        <br />
       <li> <strong><ins> Powerful Lungs : </ins></strong>Thanks to his physiology, Goku possesses
        powerful lungs, being even able to breathe in the stratosphere while
        fighting Beerus.[1][2],br/></li>
       <li>  <strong><ins>HeatResistance:</ins> </strong>Thanks to his
        Saiyan biology,
          Goku possesses an extremely high resistance to heat.
        This was first seen when he was able to calmly relax in the boiling hot
        saunas of Princess Snake's palace. As the years went by, his resistance
        to heat only increased, as he was able to fall through the Earth's
        atmosphere without burning up from the high-speed descent, or when he
        fought Broly in the high temperatures of lava. However, this could be
        because Goku's energy acts as a barrier against the lava, and not
        because his body is naturally resistant to such high temperatures.</big

       <mark> <strong>Energy Ability</strong></mark>
        <p>
          Goku has a great mastery over his Ki; the natural life force every
          being possess and uses it to increase his fighting abilities. Flight –
          The ability to take flight through the manipulation of ki. However, as
          a Saiyan, Goku already possesses the innate ability to fly, which
          later in adulthood, he has shown to completely dominate. In Dragon
          Ball Fusions, Kid Goku from the time he was training under Kami
          manages to somehow learn how to fly using ki and demonstrates the same
          proficiency at flying that his future adult self does. Ki Sense – The
          ability to sense the energy of other beings. Goku acquired the ability
          after drinking the Ultra Divine Water but was unable to use it to home
          in on an opponent's location until he trained with Mr. Popo. He can
          also hide his ki to prevent someone else senses his. Ki Transfer –
          Goku can grant some of his energy to another fighter to restore some
          of their energy. Spirit Control - Thanks to his training on Yardrat,
          Goku gained the basic level of Spirit Control, allowing him to sense
          ki at a much greater distance and use Instant Transmission. Godly Ki
          mastery – Goku can change the nature of his ki to that of the gods,
          increasing his power drastically. With the Godly Ki, Goku gains access
          to god-level transformations such as the Super Saiyan God and Super
          Saiyan Blue. Regeneration - Super Saiyan God Goku is able to
          regenerate by pouring his godly ki into his wounds. Energy
          Nullification – During his battle with Beerus, Goku learned how to
          nullify the negative damaging effects of their clash.
