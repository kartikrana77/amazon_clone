        Saitama (Japanese: サイタマ) is a fictional superhero and the
        protagonist of One's manga series One-Punch Man. Saitama, an
        unassociated hero, hails from Z-City and performs heroic deeds as a
        hobby. For three years, he has trained enough to defeat any enemy with a
        single punch, his unmatched strength leaving him bored. He becomes a
        reluctant mentor to Genos, a cyborg seeking revenge against another
        cyborg who killed his family and destroyed his hometown, after Saitama
        defeats a monster that defeated Genos. With Genos, Saitama learns about
        a heroes organization who are also fighting the monsters. The character
        was created by One as part of a webcomic involving an alternate style of
        superhero who already started as the strongest one in the world and most
        of his stories involved daily chores. For the manga serialization,
        Saitama was illustrated by Yusuke Murata. The character has been voiced
        by Makoto Furukawa in Japanese and Max Mittelman in English. Saitama has
        been a popular character, often acclaimed by the fandom of being the
        strongest character in anime history.
        <br />
        Manga author One became interested in creating a comic superhero who was
        already the strongest in the world.[1][2] He wanted to focus on
        different aspects of storytelling than those normally relied on in
        standard superhero stories, such as everyday problems. ONE said:
        "Punching is oftentimes pretty useless against life's problems. But
        inside One-Punch Man's universe, I made Saitama a sort of guy who was
        capable of adapting his life to the world that surrounded him, only
        armed with his immense power. The only obstacles he faces are mundane
        things, like running short of money."[2] The idea was that the super
        hero became bored and instead dealt with daily chores.[3] In One's point
        of view, a hero is not cool for being strong or strength. Instead, it is
        the mentality of Saitama and how he is able to understand other people's
        mentalities.[2] The idea was that the super hero became bored and
        instead dealt with daily chores.[3] One felt difficulties in drawing
        scenarios for Saitama due to how overpowered he was. In Saitama's case,
        all he have to do is have him show up to punch the problem away. In the
        world Saitama lives in, monsters show up frequently, so he gets to
        utilize his strength to the fullest, so he can feel comfortable making
        the plot. If anything happens, the author can always count on Saitama.
        The story will be interesting as long as he's on the move. The only hard
        part is to make his allies seem not too weak.[3] Artist Yusuke Murata
        initially drew him "cool" alongside the entire cast. In that process he
        was making Saitama look handsome, or adding stars in his eyes, but all
        of these ideas were scrapped. In the end, those things did not fit
        Saitama's nature. He changed it since One's ideas of Saitama was the
        complete opposite. Nevertheless, he had fun when drawing the
        character.[3] The idea of the blank expression Saitama tends to make
        were done intentionally for comedic effect. Murata also elaborated that
        while it is hard to relate to overpowered characters in fiction, the way
        One wrote Saitama managed to give this theme.[3]

    <ul>
      <big>
       <li><strong>Unparalleled Strength: </strong></li> 
        Saitama possesses seemingly limitless physical
        strength and is capable of effortlessly defeating powerful monsters and
        villains with a single, casual punch (although this strength is not
        limited to punches). His punches are so powerful that many monsters
        simply explode when struck. An example of this casual yet overwhelming
        offensive power occurs when Saitama launches himself from the top of a
        building, blasts right through a giant meteor with a punch, lands
        safely, and calmly decides to go home.[68] Another instance is when
        Sonic tries to attack Saitama with a sword; he stops the sword by
        catching it with his teeth, effortlessly shattering the blade with the
        power of his jaw.[69] When launched from Earth to the moon by Boros, he
        used his jumping power to return to Earth in mere moments, causing a
        huge shockwave and leaving a massive crater on the surface of the moon
        upon departure.[70] A "normal" punch from him was shown to be highly
        destructive, even to someone as durable as Boros.[71] A single "serious"
        punch from him was able to counter the latter's strongest attack,
        Collapsing Star Roaring Cannon, an attack capable of destroying the
        entire planet. Not only did Saitama completely negate Boros' final
        attack using his serious punch, but the shockwave from the punch was
        also powerful enough to part clouds on a global scale.[72] When fighting
        Orochi, the high-speed pressure of the lava fired from his hands was
        enough to overpower and completely disperse Orochi's Gaia Cannon, an
        incredibly powerful attack that drew energy from the Earth's core and
        caused worldwide earthquakes.[73] Additionally, he is capable of
        destroying the Earth if he wanted to,[74] and has threatened to do so
        when irritated.[75] His strength has been stated by numerous characters
        to defy reason.[76][77][78] With only one hand, Saitama could lift the
        entire surface of Io, a moon of Jupiter, launching its wreckage
        thousands of kilometers into space.[79] In his fight against Cosmic Fear
        Mode Garou, who could perfectly replicate the power of Saitama's Serious
        Punch, a collision of their respective punches formed a Serious Punch²,
        resulting in immensely powerful waves of energy that threatened to
        destroy the Earth. After being diverted by Blast and his allies, the
        compressed energy from Serious Punch² further travelled into outer space
        before exploding and (presumably) destroying numerous star systems in
        the far distance, leaving a massive hole of starless-darkness in the
        cosmos.[80] In the climax of the fight against Garou on Io, Saitama was
        able to accidentally blow away half the gas of Jupiter, the largest
        planet in the solar system, with a Serious Sneze.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <li><strong> Unparalleled Speed and Reflexes:  </strong></li> 
        Saitama possesses
        unparalleled speed and reflexes. He was able to complete a 1500-meter
        dash in an instant during his hero tryouts.[87] He has proven able to
        effortlessly outpace Speed-o'-Sound Sonic, a ninja whose specialty is
        his superspeed.[88][89] Even Genos's computerized targeting systems have
        difficulty tracking him.[90] Saitama has also shown the ability to run
        down a building to save a piece of salmon he was having for lunch, and
        leap back up said building without bystanders noticing he had even done
        so.[49] His speed is so impressive that he can even outpace Flashy
        Flash, an S-Class hero well-known for his extraordinary speed, easily
        dodging his sword swings and catching his ultimate technique.[91] When
        kicked to the moon by Boros, Saitama was able to return to Earth in mere
        seconds.[92] In addition, he was capable of easily reacting to and
        blocking Geryuganshoop's near-lightspeed rocks, the speed of which being
        like a bad joke to him.[93] Io Destroyed Saitama travelling across Io at
        incredibly high speeds In his fight against evolved monster Garou,
        Saitama proved himself firmly superior to and able to effortlessly keep
        up with him, despite the Hero Hunter previously being capable of
        creating a giant light structure alongside Platinum Sperm in only 0.0013
        seconds (1.3 milliseconds) through sheer speed.[94][95][96] Later on,
        while fighting Garou on Io, one of Jupiter's moons, after flipping a
        large amount of ground into the air with his Serious Table Flip, Saitama
        was capable of covering immensely huge distances by dashing across tons
        of rubble, having jumped around the natural satellite so fast that a
        large constellation was created from his sheer speed.[97] Ironically,
        despite his incomparable reflexes and speed, he still has problems
        squashing a simple mosquito.[98] During his training days when he still
        had his hair, Saitama tried turning his head around super fast to see
        the back of his head reflected in a mirror. Despite having failed
        initially, in the end, Saitama was apparently able to catch sight of the
        back of his head.[99] Serious Side Hops Saitama creating countless
        afterimages Afterimage Creation: Saitama's speed allows him to create
        afterimages of himself. He first used this during his training bout with
        Genos.[100] He was also able to create countless afterimages via his
        Serious Side Hops during his fight with Speed-o'-Sound Sonic.[101]
        Supernatural Dexterity and Agility: Saitama is capable of moving any of
        his limbs at extremely fast speeds without flinching, not stopping until
        his target is completely obliterated. This is seen when he flawlessly
        whacks all moles on a Whack-A-Mole machine during the Hero Association
        exam.[102] He has been shown to be perfect at dodging and performing
        highly acrobatic maneuvers.[103] His reflexes render him flexible enough
        to move through the narrowest creeks and dodge attacks at the closest
        proximity.[104][105] When bombarded by multiple giant bullets from
        Boros's ship, despite being in mid-air, Saitama could evade all the
        projectiles before kicking one of them back to the ship itself.[106]
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <li><strong>Water Running:  </strong></li> 
        Saitama is capable of running across the ocean high-speed
        without going into the surface of water.[107] Superhuman Stamina and
        Endurance: After becoming too powerful from his training regimen,
        Saitama has no longer been shown to tire out when fighting enemies. The
        only time he was shown to be panting and out of breath from continuous
        running, he recovered just seconds later.[108] He could still suppress
        pain even before gaining his overwhelming power.[109][110] This has been
        shown on numerous occasions dating back to his days as a middle school
        student, taking a beating from two upper-level students and, later Piggy
        Bancon, a Wolf-level threat. Saitama then got back up when the bullies
        could not and chased after the pig-like monster for his money.[111]
        Other similar feats include enduring strikes from Crablante and
        Personification Of A Light Pull Cord during his training as an adult
        among others. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <li><strong> Supernatural Senses:  </strong></li> 
        Saitama's senses are far beyond the
        human norm. He possesses impressively sharp hearing, being able to pick
        up on various chatter from bystanders a good distance away even while
        fighting monsters and the like.[112] He can even hear phone
        transmissions with well enough accuracy to gauge conversation and the
        contents of its dialogue.[47] Furthermore, Saitama's eyesight is
        superhuman. After being kicked to the Moon by Boros, he could pinpoint
        the location of the giant spaceship and land back on it from a distance
        a little more than one light-second.[92] His tracking capability is also
        astonishing, as he can concentrate on a fast-moving object for a long
        time and still not lose sight of it, as seen when he was the only person
        to see where Garou escaped to.[113][114] He is also able to see in the
        dark, as he was able to spot a kid a great distance away during the
        night.[115] 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <li><strong>Invulnerability:  </strong></li> 
        Saitama possesses unparalleled toughness
        and durability. He can withstand blows from extremely powerful beings
        such as Carnage Kabuto and even Boros without suffering any injury or
        feeling any pain.[116] In fact, no character has actually been able to
        damage, or even physically harm Saitama in any way. When Genos created a
        huge, spherical blast of flame to kill Mosquito Girl's mosquitoes,
        Saitama remained standing right next to him completely unharmed (though
        his clothes were burnt).[117] He even survived the harsh conditions of
        outer space unscathed during his brief time on the moon.[118] It has
        been shown that, despite the dangers of holding one's breath in space,
        Saitama can do so with no negative effects on his body. Another
        testament to his astonishing durability is that Garou, who, despite
        having gained enormous strength from monsterization, still could not
        inflict even the slightest damage on Saitama during their fight.[94][95]
        Notably, he was capable of withstanding Garou's Extreme Fa Jin, an
        attack powerful enough to raise up a large landmass all the way on the
        other side of the planet, without any damage taken at all.[96] Against
        Cosmic Fear Mode Garou, who has become influenced by "God", a mysterious
        entity that possesses frightening supernatural powers, Saitama could
        easily withstand nuclear explosions generated by the Hero Hunter's
        Nuclear Fission at point-blank.[119] Even after taking Garou's Gamma Ray
        Burst head-on, he emerged unscathed from the energy blast that was
        narratively described to be the same phenomenon as a gamma ray burst,
        the most powerful type of explosion known in the universe.[120] Later,
        despite being constantly hit by Garou's punches with the same force as
        his own Serious Punch, Saitama still came out victorious without
        noticeable damage.[121] Saitama prefers to dodge or block attacks using
        edged weapons,[122][123] rather than take them head-on, as he sometimes
        does with strikes from fists or blunt objects. However, Nyan's powerful
        claws, which can cut buildings into pieces, were shown unable to affect
        Saitama's head, indicating that his skin is highly resistance to
        piercing damage as well.[124] Additionally, Garou's Whirlwind Iron
        Cutting Fist could only destroy Saitama's clothing without cutting the
        skin underneath.[125] Internal Durability: Not only are his flesh and
        muscles incredibly tough and sturdy, but Saitama's vital organs are also
        extremely durable and thus highly resistant to damage. This has been
        demonstrated in his fight against Garou; despite the latter specifically
        targeting and attacking the innards inside his body with a few martial
        arts techniques, Saitama was able to come out completely unscathed.
        Saitama holds his breath on the moon with no difficulty Saitama holding
        his breath on the moon with no difficulty 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <li><strong>Vacuum Adaptation: </strong></li>  
        Saitama has
        considerable control over his breath. Even in outer space, he manages to
        hold his breath effortlessly, and he even made a jump back to the Earth
        from the Moon in seconds with no signs of suffocation.[126] His body has
        been shown to even adapt to and survive in the vacuum of space
        unscathed. Several factors, like a lack of atmosphere and increased
        radiation exposure, are at play here, although Saitama was not affected
        by any of them.[127] This was prominently shown in his fight against
        Garou on Io, one of Jupiter's moons, where he was unaffected by the thin
        and unbreathable atmosphere there.[128] Saitama immerses in magma
        Saitama submerging in lava with no problem 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <li><strong>Temperature Resistance: </strong></li> 
        Saitama is extremely resistant to all types of temperature-based
        attacks. When Genos created a huge, spherical blast of flame to
        incinerate Mosquito Girl's mosquitoes, Saitama remained standing next to
        the cyborg unperturbed and completely unharmed (although his clothes
        were burnt to a crisp).[129] Despite being completely frozen by Withered
        Sprout, he was able to instantly shatter the ice and free himself,
        completely unfazed by the monster's cryokinesis.[130] He has shown
        capable of tolerating Io's surface temperature that averages about minus
        130 degrees Celsius,[131] for at least some time and while naked.[121]
        Additionally, Saitama is capable of submerging himself in lava with no
        trouble, viewing it as a nice hot tub.[73] Even Boros's ability to
        project energy with intense heat that melts sections of the giant
        spaceship, could not faze him.[92] Saitama can also withstand multiple
        nuclear explosions point-blank, tolerating the intense heat from them
        without even flinching.[119] This ability can be attributed to him
        refusing to use either the air conditioner or heater during his
        training. Radiation Resistance: Saitama's body is strongly resistant to
        radiation. When he was kicked to the moon by Boros, he was not affected
        by the increased level of radiation in space. When faced with multiple
        nuclear explosions created by Garou, Saitama was able to meet them
        head-on and inhale the massive doses of radiation emitted in those
        subsequent mushroom clouds, unaffectedly.[132] He could also stand near
        Garou unbothered, despite the latter's mere presence being radioactive
        enough to kill many other heroes close by within mere moments and even
        endanger all life on Earth.[120] Furthermore, after being directly hit
        by Garou's Gamma Ray Burst, a powerful energy blast that was described
        to be the same phenomenon as a gamma ray burst, Saitama emerged
        unscathed from the high level of radiation contained in the
        beam.[119][120] 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <li><strong>Psychic Resistance:  </strong></li> 
        Saitama is resistant to psychic
        power. In his scuffle with Tatsumaki, he is able to easily resist the
        female esper's attempt to throw him into space. It is noteworthy to know
        that Saitama's muscles merely "twitched" when Tatsumaki used her psychic
        powers on him and that she was not able to keep him up in the air for
        more than a few seconds because he was "too heavy".[133] This
        demonstrates that Saitama is not completely immune to the effects of
        psychokinesis. In the original webcomic, Fubuki noted that Saitama's
        resistance to psychic power comes from his astonishing willpower,[133]
        although this hasn't been mentioned in the manga. Accelerated
        Development: Nearly a year into his training regiment, Saitama noted
        that as a result of his repetitive routine, his body had adapted to
        "moving like a hero should",[110] and his power began to explode at a
        rapid rate. In no time at all, he reached unparalleled levels of
        strength, speed, and durability through this regiment, a testament to
        his growth rate. According to Genos, Saitama himself cannot explain the
        secret behind his strength.[62] In his fight with Garou on Io, Saitama's
        growth rate began to soar exponentially due to the intense emotions he
        was experiencing.[121]
